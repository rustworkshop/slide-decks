## Slides from markdown

This and the following slides are from

`rust-workshop.md`

as pointed to by

`rust-workshop.html`

```html [2]
<section
    data-markdown="rust-workshop.md"
    data-separator="^---$"
    data-separator-vertical="^--$"
    data-separator-notes="^\*\*Speaker Notes:\*\*$"

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
## Showing code

Starting point, highlighted lines with `[3-4]` unique id for matching across slides in `data-id`.

```rust [3-4]
// Abstract away storage to allow
// testing via dependency injection
pub trait Storage {
}
```
<!-- .element: data-id="code" -->

--

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

## Showing code

Add code to same block with same id, then progressively highlight different lines with `[3,7|4|5-6]`

```rust [3,7|4|5-6]
// Abstract away storage to allow
// testing via dependency injection
pub trait Storage {
	fn exists(&self) -> bool;
	fn save(&self, state_toml: String);
	fn read(&self) -> String;
}
```
<!-- .element: data-id="code" -->

## Fade link bullets

It's tricky to mark this up right, because the html comment applies to the generated html element before/around it, so you have to consider that a link is an element inside a bullet. It's a bit fragile.

- Code  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> [github.com/rustworkshop](https://github.com/rustworkshop) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- <https://rustworkshop.co/> <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

**Speaker Notes:**

- Note that it is the html element that the comment refers to, so if you put a link in, that's a different element and it breaks apart the fade so you have to repeat the html comment.
- There also seems to be a bug around showing the first bullet with a link.
